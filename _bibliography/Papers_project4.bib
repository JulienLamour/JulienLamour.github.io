	abstract = {Stomata play a central role in regulating the exchange of carbon dioxide and water vapor between ecosystems and the atmosphere. Their function is represented in land surface models (LSMs) by conductance models. The Functionally Assembled Terrestrial Ecosystem Simulator (FATES) is a dynamic vegetation demography model that can simulate both detailed plant demographic and physiological dynamics. To evaluate the effect of stomatal conductance model formulation on forest water and carbon fluxes in FATES, we implemented an optimality-based stomatal conductance model – the Medlyn (MED) model – that simulates the relationship between photosynthesis (A) and stomatal conductance to water vapor (gsw) as an alternative to the FATES default Ball–Woodrow–Berry (BWB) model. To evaluate how the behavior of FATES is affected by stomatal model choice, we conducted a model sensitivity analysis to explore the response of gsw to climate forcing, including atmospheric CO2 concentration, air temperature, radiation, and vapor pressure deficit in the air (VPDa). We found that modeled gsw values varied greatly between the BWB and MED formulations due to the different default stomatal slope parameters (g1). After harmonizing g1 and holding the stomatal intercept parameter (g0) constant for both model formulations, we found that the divergence in modeled gsw was limited to conditions when the VPDa exceeded 1.5 kPa. We then evaluated model simulation results against measurements from a wet evergreen forest in Panama. Results showed that both the MED and BWB model formulations were able to capture the magnitude and diurnal changes of measured gsw and A but underestimated both by about 30 % when the soil was predicted to be very dry. Comparison of modeled soil water content from FATES to a reanalysis product showed that FATES captured soil drying well, but translation of drying soil to modeled physiology reduced the models' ability to match observations. Our study suggests that the parameterization of stomatal conductance models and current model response to drought are the critical areas for improving model simulation of CO2 and water fluxes in tropical forests.},

	abstract = {Despite its importance for determining global carbon fluxes, leaf respiration remains poorly constrained in land surface models (LSMs). We tested the sensitivity of the Energy Exascale Earth System Model Land Model???Functionally Assembled Terrestrial Ecosystem Simulator (ELM-FATES) to variation in the canopy gradients of leaf maintenance respiration (Rdark). We ran global and point simulations varying the canopy gradient of Rdark to explore the impacts on forest structure, composition, and carbon cycling. In global simulations, steeper canopy gradients of Rdark lead to increased understory survival and leaf biomass. Leaf area index (LAI) increased up to 77\% in tropical regions compared with the default parameterization, improving alignment with remotely sensed benchmarks. Global vegetation carbon varied from 308 Pg C to 449 Pg C across the ensemble. In tropical forest simulations, steeper gradients of Rdark had a large impact on successional dynamics. Results show the importance of canopy gradients in leaf traits and fluxes for determining plant carbon budgets and emergent ecosystem properties such as competitive dynamics, LAI, and vegetation carbon. The high-model sensitivity to canopy gradients in Rdark highlights the need for more observations of how leaf traits and fluxes vary along light micro-environments to inform critical dynamics in LSMs.},

	abstract = {Predicting tropical tree demography is a key challenge in understanding the future dynamics of tropical forests. Although demographic processes are known to be regulated by leaf trait diversity, only the effect of inter-specific trait variation has been evaluated, and it remains unclear as to what degree the intra-specific trait plasticity across light gradients (hereafter light plasticity) regulates tree demography, and how this will further shape long-term community and ecosystem dynamics. By combining in situ trait measurements and forest census data with a terrestrial biosphere model, we evaluated the impact of observation-constrained light plasticity on demography, forest structure, and biomass dynamics in a Panamanian tropical moist forest. Modeled leaf physiological traits vary across and within plant functional types (PFT), which represent the inter-specific trait variation and the intra-specific light plasticity, respectively. The simulation using three non-plastic PFTs underestimated 20-year average understory growth rates by 41\%, leading to a biased forest size structure and leaf area profile, and a 44\% underestimate in long-term biomass. The simulation using three plastic PFTs generated accurate understory growth rates, resulting in a realistic forest structure and a smaller biomass underestimate of 15\%. Expanding simulated trait diversity using 18 nonplastic PFTs similarly improved the prediction of demography and biomass. However, only the plasticity-enabled model predicted realistic long-term PFT composition and within-canopy trait profiles. Our results highlight the distinct role of light plasticity in regulating forest dynamics that cannot be replaced by inter-specific trait diversity. Accurately representing light plasticity is thus crucial for trait-based prediction of tropical forest dynamics.},
