	abstract = {Terrestrial biosphere models (TBMs) include the representation of vertical gradients in leaf traits associated with modeling photosynthesis, respiration, and stomatal conductance. However, model assumptions associated with these gradients have not been tested in complex tropical forest canopies. We compared TBM representation of the vertical gradients of key leaf traits with measurements made in a tropical forest in Panama and then quantified the impact of the observed gradients on simulated canopy-scale CO2 and water fluxes. Comparison between observed and TBM trait gradients showed divergence that impacted canopy-scale simulations of water vapor and CO2 exchange. Notably, the ratio between the dark respiration rate and the maximum carboxylation rate was lower near the ground than at the top-of-canopy, leaf-level water-use efficiency was markedly higher at the top-of-canopy, and the decrease in maximum carboxylation rate from the top-of-canopy to the ground was less than TBM assumptions. The representation of the gradients of leaf traits in TBMs is typically derived from measurements made within-individual plants, or, for some traits, assumed constant due to a lack of experimental data. Our work shows that these assumptions are not representative of the trait gradients observed in species-rich, complex tropical forests.},

	abstract = {Forest disturbances increase the proportion of fast-growing tree species compared to slow-growing ones. To understand their relative capacity for carbon uptake and their vulnerability to climate change, and to represent those differences in Earth system models, it is necessary to characterise the physiological differences in their leaf-level control of water use efficiency and carbon assimilation. We used wood density as a proxy for the fast-slow growth spectrum and tested the assumption that trees with a low wood density (LWD) have a lower water-use efficiency than trees with a high wood density (HWD). We selected 5 LWD tree species and 5 HWD tree species growing in the same location in an Amazonian tropical forest and measured in situ steady-state gas exchange on top-of-canopy leaves with parallel sampling and measurement of leaf mass area and leaf nitrogen content. We found that LWD species invested more nitrogen in photosynthetic capacity than HWD species, had higher photosynthetic rates and higher stomatal conductance. However, contrary to expectations, we showed that the stomatal control of the balance between transpiration and carbon assimilation was similar in LWD and HWD species and that they had the same dark respiration rates.},

	abstract = {Vegetative transpiration (E) and photosynthetic carbon assimilation (A) are known to be seasonally dynamic, with changes in their ratio determining the marginal water use efficiency (WUE). Despite an understanding that stomata play a mechanistic role in regulating WUE, it is still unclear how stomatal and nonstomatal processes influence change in WUE over the course of the growing season. As a result, limited understanding of the primary physiological drivers of seasonal dynamics of canopy WUE remains one of the largest uncertainties in earth system model projections of carbon and water exchange in temperate deciduous forest ecosystems. We investigated seasonal patterns in leaf-level physiological, hydraulic, and anatomical properties, including the seasonal progress of the stomatal slope parameter (g1; inversely proportional to WUE) and the maximum carboxylation rate (Vcmax). Vcmax and g1 were seasonally variable; however, their patterns were not temporally synchronized. g1 generally showed an increasing trend until late in the season, while Vcmax peaked during the midsummer months. Seasonal progression of Vcmax was primarily driven by changes in leaf structural, and anatomical characteristics, while seasonal changes in g1 were most strongly related to changes in Vcmax and leaf hydraulics. Using a seasonally variable Vcmax and g1 to parameterize a canopy-scale gas exchange model increased seasonally aggregated A and E by 3\% and 16\%, respectively.},

	abstract = {Understanding seasonal variation in photosynthesis is important for understanding and modeling plant productivity. Here, we used shotgun sampling to examine physiological, structural and spectral leaf traits of upper canopy, sun-exposed leaves in Quercus coccinea Münchh (scarlet oak) across the growing season in order to understand seasonal trends, explore the mechanisms underpinning physiological change and investigate the impact of extrapolating measurements from a single date to the whole season. We tested the hypothesis that photosynthetic rates and capacities would peak at the summer solstice, i.e., at the time of peak photoperiod. Contrary to expectations, our results reveal a late-season peak in both photosynthetic capacity and rate before the expected sharp decrease at the start of senescence. This late-season maximum occurred after the higher summer temperatures and vapor pressure deficit and was correlated with the recovery of leaf water content and increased stomatal conductance. We modeled photosynthesis at the top of the canopy and found that the simulated results closely tracked the maximum carboxylation capacity of Rubisco. For both photosynthetic capacity and modeled top-of-canopy photosynthesis, the maximum value was therefore not observed at the summer solstice. Rather, in each case, the measurements at and around the solstice were close to the overall seasonal mean, with values later in the season leading to deviations from the mean by up to 41 and 52\%, respectively. Overall, we found that the expected Gaussian pattern of photosynthesis was not observed. We conclude that an understanding of species- and environment-specific changes in photosynthesis across the season is essential for correct estimation of seasonal photosynthetic capacity.},
