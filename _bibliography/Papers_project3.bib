	abstract = {Accurate assessment of leaf functional traits is crucial for a diverse range of applications from crop phenotyping to parameterizing global climate models. Leaf reflectance spectroscopy offers a promising avenue to advance ecological and of robust hyperspectral models for predicting leaf photosynthetic capacity and associated traits from reflectance data has been hindered by limited data availability across species and environments. Here we introduce the Global Spectra-Trait Initiative (GSTI), a collaborative repository of paired leaf hyperspectral and gas exchange measurements from diverse ecosystems. The GSTI repository currently encompasses over 7500 observations from 397 species and 41 sites gathered from 36 published and unpublished studies, thereby offering a key resource for developing and validating hyperspectral models of leaf photosynthetic agricultural research by complementing traditional, time-consuming gas exchange measurements. However, the development capacity. The GSTI database is developed on GitHub (https://github.com/plantphys/gsti) and published to ESS-dive https://data.ess-dive.lbl.gov/datasets/doi:10.15485/2530733, Lamour et al., 2025). It includes gas exchange data, derived photosynthetic parameters, and key leaf traits often associated with traditional gas exchange measurements such as leaf mass per area and leaf elemental composition. By providing a standardized repository for data sharing and analysis, we present a critical step towards creating hyperspectral models for predicting photosynthetic traits and associated leaf traits for terrestrial plants.},

	title = {Rapid estimation of photosynthetic leaf traits of tropical plants in diverse environmental conditions using reflectance spectroscopy},
	volume = {16},
	doi = {10.1371/journal.pone.0258791},
	abstract = {Tropical forests are one of the main carbon sinks on Earth, but the magnitude of CO2 absorbed by tropical vegetation remains uncertain. Terrestrial biosphere models (TBMs) are commonly used to estimate the CO2 absorbed by forests, but their performance is highly sensitive to the parameterization of processes that control leaf-level CO2 exchange. Direct measurements of leaf respiratory and photosynthetic traits that determine vegetation CO2 fluxes are critical, but traditional approaches are time-consuming. Reflectance spectroscopy can be a viable alternative for the estimation of these traits and, because data collection is markedly quicker than traditional gas exchange, the approach can enable the rapid assembly of large datasets. However, the application of spectroscopy to estimate photosynthetic traits across a wide range of tropical species, leaf ages and light environments has not been extensively studied. Here, we used leaf reflectance spectroscopy together with partial least-squares regression (PLSR) modeling to estimate leaf respiration (Rdark25), the maximum rate of carboxylation by the enzyme Rubisco (Vcmax25), the maximum rate of electron transport (Jmax25), and the triose phosphate utilization rate (Tp25), all normalized to 25°C. We collected data from three tropical forest sites and included leaves from fifty-three species sampled at different leaf phenological stages and different leaf light environments. Our resulting spectra-trait models validated on randomly sampled data showed good predictive performance for Vcmax25, Jmax25, Tp25 and Rdark25 (RMSE of 13, 20, 1.5 and 0.3 μmol m-2 s-1, and R2 of 0.74, 0.73, 0.64 and 0.58, respectively). The models showed similar performance when applied to leaves of species not included in the training dataset, illustrating that the approach is robust for capturing the main axes of trait variation in tropical species. We discuss the utility of the spectra-trait and traditional gas exchange approaches for enhancing tropical plant trait studies and improving the parameterization of TBMs.},

	volume = {72},
	issn = {0022-0957},
	doi = {10.1093/jxb/erab295},
	abstract ={Partial least squares regression (PLSR) modelling is a statistical technique for correlating datasets, and involves the fitting of a linear regression between two matrices. One application of PLSR enables leaf traits to be estimated from hyperspectral optical reflectance data, facilitating rapid, high-throughput, non-destructive plant phenotyping. This technique is of interest and importance in a wide range of contexts including crop breeding and ecosystem monitoring. The lack of a consensus in the literature on how to perform PLSR means that interpreting model results can be challenging, applying existing models to novel datasets can be impossible, and unknown or undisclosed assumptions can lead to incorrect or spurious predictions. We address this lack of consensus by proposing best practices for using PLSR to predict plant traits from leaf-level hyperspectral data, including a discussion of when PLSR is applicable, and recommendations for data collection. We provide a tutorial to demonstrate how to develop a PLSR model, in the form of an R script accompanying this manuscript. This practical guide will assist all those interpreting and using PLSR models to predict leaf traits from spectral data, and advocates for a unified approach to using PLSR for predicting traits from spectra in the plant sciences.},

	abstract = {Leaf dark respiration (Rdark), an important yet rarely quantified component of carbon cycling in forest ecosystems, is often simulated from leaf traits such as the maximum carboxylation capacity (Vcmax), leaf mass per area (LMA), nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) concentrations, in terrestrial biosphere models. However, the validity of these relationships across forest types remains to be thoroughly assessed. Here, we analyzed Rdark variability and its associations with Vcmax and other leaf traits across three temperate, subtropical and tropical forests in China, evaluating the effectiveness of leaf spectroscopy as a superior monitoring alternative. We found that leaf magnesium and calcium concentrations were more significant in explaining cross-site Rdark than commonly used traits like LMA, N and P concentrations, but univariate trait?Rdark relationships were always weak (r2?≤?0.15) and forest-specific. Although multivariate relationships of leaf traits improved the model performance, leaf spectroscopy outperformed trait?Rdark relationships, accurately predicted cross-site Rdark (r2?=?0.65) and pinpointed the factors contributing to Rdark variability. Our findings reveal a few novel traits with greater cross-site scalability regarding Rdark, challenging the use of empirical trait?Rdark relationships in process models and emphasize the potential of leaf spectroscopy as a promising alternative for estimating Rdark, which could ultimately improve process modeling of terrestrial plant respiration.},
