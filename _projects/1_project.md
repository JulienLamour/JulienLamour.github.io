I am interested in how leaf gas exchange is represented in vegetation models used to study the couplings between the atmosphere and forests. The processes of photosynthesis and transpiration respond directly to increasing CO2 and temperature, and govern carbon input into ecosystems with multiple implications for growth dynamics and resistance to water stress. Key uncertainties remain regarding the response to temperature and CO2 in the short and long terms.
