The standard reference method for estimating leaf photosynthetic properties uses gas exchange measurements. These measurements allow for the estimation of fundamental biochemical properties such as the velocity of carboxylation by the Rubisco enzyme, the electron transport rate, leaf respiration, or properties related to the control of transpiration by the stomata. These measurements are very accurate but also time-consuming, typically requiring one to two hours per leaf to characterize, which limits the capacity to study ecosystems with high biodiversity.

A goal of my research is to develop alternative measurements using spectroscopy based on the measurement of reflectance in the visible and near-infrared (400 – 2500 nm). These methods aim to use the information present in the spectrum to estimate leaf traits, particularly photosynthetic traits. A key advantage of these methods is the speed of measurement (a few seconds) and the possibility of predicting numerous traits simultaneously (photosynthetic traits, chemical composition, etc.).
