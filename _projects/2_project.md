To simulate interactions between forests, climate, and carbon and water cycles, a major challenge lies in successfully parameterizing gas exchange models to represent the great functional diversity of species and their response to environmental changes. In many terrestrial models, the extraordinary diversity of tropical species is often drastically simplified into one or two representative species. New models are attempting to better represent functional diversity in order to more accurately capture the effect of this diversity on ecosystem resilience and to predict changes in floristic composition in the face of climate change.
